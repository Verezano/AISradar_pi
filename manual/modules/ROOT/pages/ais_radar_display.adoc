=== What and Why

A. *What does AIS Radar-pi do*

AIS RADAR is a plugin that allows you to display AIS targets in the way
ships are displayed on a radar screen.

*Note*: Do not confuse this with the additional supplements that overlap
the Ship's radar screen on the OpenCPN screen.

B. *Why should I want it?*

If you want a simple screen, showing only the AIS targets, AIS Radar can
be just what you are looking for.

=== Installation

*Note*: In this section the instructions are specifically for AIS
Radar-pi, but there is a dedicated page in the manual with information
about Downloading, Installing and Enabling Plugins in general. That
dedicated page can be found here:
link:../install_and_enable.html[Plugins - Install and Enable].

AIS-Radar-pi can be downloaded from http://www.opencpn.org/index.html +
 +
Click “*Downloads*”

Click “*Plugins for OpenCPN 4.2 & 4.4*”

Look for “*AIS Radar View”*“

*B. How to install the plug-in*

Make sure you choose the file that is compatible with your
computersystem. In this manual we presume it's Windows, so we choose the
*Windows setup-package*. +
Download the file (double-click).

We assume you know where to find the files you download from the
Internet (if you don't: quit now and read the manual of your computer
before doing anything else with it

Double-click the downloaded file and follow the set-up instructions.

That's it. But before you can actually *use* the plug-in, you first have
to *enable* that plug-in in OpenCPN.

=== Enabling the plug-in in OpenCPN

Open (or restart) OpenCPN.

Click *Tools*-*Options*-*Plugins*

image::object_search_04.jpeg[]

image::object_search_05.jpeg[]

Scroll down untill you see the AIS Radar-pi.

image::ais_radar_enable.jpeg[]

Click “*Enable*” and then “*Preferences*”.

image::ais_radar_preferences.jpeg[]

The list of preferences is simple:

* Show RADAR icon
** This box toggles displaying the icon in the OpenCPN icon bar.
* Use AIS as Radar Source.
** Ticking this box will allow AIS Radar View to use the information
from your AIS receiver (make sure your AIS receiver is set up in OpenCPN
in “Tools”-“Options”-“Connections”). +

Click “*OK*”.

Now the AIS Radar icon should appear somewhere in your OpenCPN Toolbar.

image::ais_radar_icon.jpeg[]

link:ais_radar_display.html[Back to top of page ↑] +

=== Standard actions

When you click the AIS Radar-pi icon, you will see a radar-screen like
representation of the AIS-targets around you. +
They are represented by triangular ship-icons. Yellow if not fully
recognized yet, green when fully recognized.

When your own ship has not just an AIS-receiver, but an AIS
*transponder* (and *sends* AIS signals), you will see such an icon in
the centre of the screen. That's you.

On the bottom of the screen you can set some options. You can set
different ranges in AIS Radar. From 0.25 nm to 32 nm.

image::ais_radar_ranges.jpeg[]

You can also choose “North Up” (when it's not selected, the view will be
“Course Up”) and you can select “EBL” (“Electronic Bearing Line”).

With EBL selected, a mouse-click on the AIS Radar screen will give you a
bearing in degrees. That bearing is always in degrees relative to North,
not relative to your course. +

link:ais_radar_display.html[Back to top of page ↑] +

=== Operation

Two operating modes are possible: +

* *North*-up,
* *COG* up, or “Course Up”. +

You can select “North Up” on the bottom of the screen. +
If you select “North Up”, you will see the text “North Up” in the right
hand top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. +
If you do *not* select “North Up”, AIS Radar Screen will operate in
“*COG* up” mode and you will see the text “Course Up” in the right hand
top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. +

link:ais_radar_display.html[Back to top of page ↑]

=== Mode "North up"

image::ais_radar_ebl_north_up.jpeg[]

“North Up” is selected. You will see the text “North Up” in the right
hand top corner of the AIS Radar Screen. +

Also you will see the letters “*N*”, “*E*”, “*S*” and “*W*”. They
indicate North, East, South and West. +

The range is set to 8 nautical miles. +
The *center* of the screen, where the vertical and the horizontal axes
cross, *is your own position*. +

All vessels with an AIS transmitter, Class A or B, within the chosen
distance, will be displayed on the screen (“AIS-targets”) and their
positions will be updated as they (and/or you) move. +

There is no ship-icon in the middle. That is because in this example you
are only receiving AIS-signals and not sending them. +
If you would be transmitting AIS-signals, you would see a ship-icon (us)
in the middle of the screen. If your boat does *not* send AIS-signals
but you *do* see a ship-icon in the middle of the screen, you have
rammed another ship! (*maybe you should have set a Watchdog-alarm?*)

*Note*: the AIS Radar relies not only on the other ships sending
AIS-signals, but also on your equipment receiving those signals!

“*EBL*” (Electronic Bearing Line) is also selected.

image::ais_radar_ebl.jpeg[]

In the top left quadrant of the screen you see an AIS Target. It is the
_“Princ Zadra”_ coming from the North West. By putting the mouse-cursor
on that ship and clicking, the EBL will tell you the true bearing of
that ship from your position. In this case that true bearing is 312
degrees. It's true, believe us.

Any target that:

* moves *towards* the center of the screen is a boat that can
“potentially”, collide with the boat of the user.
* moves *away* from the center of the screen, is a boat that presents no
risk of collision with the boat of the user.

 

=== Mode "Course Up" ("COG up")

If you do not select “North Up”, AIS Radar Screen will operate in “COG
up” mode and you will see the text “Course Up” in the right hand top
corner of the AIS Radar Screen. +

The next screenshot is the same situation as described in the part ”
Mode “North up”, but now in “Course Up” mode. +

image::ais_radar_ebl_course_up.jpeg[]

Note that the numerical value displayed at the top of the vertical axis
gives your COG. In this case that numerical value is 306 degrees. That
means you are heading North West.

Also note that on the screen the _“Princ Zadra”_ (which is coming from
the North West) is now coming almost straight “down” towards you. +
Theoretically, in “COG up” the targets directly in front of your ship
should be permanently oriented towards the top of the screen. BUT, also
note that with each variation of your own COG, the entire screen rotates
either in one direction or the other. It's movements are non-existent if
you follow a constant heading. +

Any target that:

* moves *towards* the center of the screen is a boat that can
“potentially”, collide with the boat of the user.
* moves *away* from the center of the screen, is a boat that presents no
risk of collision with the boat of the user.

=== Remarks

Keep in mind that the plugin has advantages but also some things to be
aware of. The big advantage of AIS Radar is that it is not very complex.
But keep in mind that the information on the screen is sometimes less
than the information you will get in the “normal” AIS Target Information
on the main screen of OpenCPN.

We will illustrate that with a few screenshots of a ship approaching us
from our port quarter.

It's a ship called “_Eemshorn_”.

Looking at the AIS Radar screen you might think she is just an ordinary
ship like any other ship.

This is the info on the *AIS Radar* screen.

image::ais_radar_noparticulars.jpeg[]

But the AIS Target Information on the main screen of OpenCPN would give
you some important additional information. In this case that she is a
dredger and restricted in her manoeuverability.

This is the info on the *OpenCPN* screen.

And instead of the EBL in AIS Radar you could use an EBL made with the
plugin OpenCPN DRAW (ODraw).

This is the info on the OpenCPN-screen with an *EBL made with ODraw*.
